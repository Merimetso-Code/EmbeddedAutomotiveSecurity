# Exercise 10 - Exploiting the bugs you found

The goal of this extecise is to analyse the source code, and ELF binary, of an application and develop a appropriate exploit. To analyse the ELF binary you should use the Radare2/Cutter tool. The following is the source code for the application to be analysed. The two development boards should be connected together via the CAN bus.

* [Application Source Code for MPC5748G Development Board A](https://github.com/Merimetso-Code/EmbeddedAutomotiveSecurity/blob/main/Exercise10-A.7z)
* [Application Source Code for MPC5748G Development Board B - Processor Z4_0](https://github.com/Merimetso-Code/EmbeddedAutomotiveSecurity/blob/main/Exercise10-B.7z)

Using source analysis you would identify a set of possible vulnerabilities and then using the GNU Debugger within the S32 Design Studio and Radare2/Cutter you should validate the vulnerabilities and develop appropriate exploit code.
