# Exercise 10 - Exploiting the Bugs You Found

The goal of this exercise is to analyse the source code of an application and develop an appropriate exploit. To analyse the ELF binary you should use the Radare2/Cutter tool. The following is the source code for the application to be analysed.

* [Application Source Code for SPC560P Development Board](https://github.com/Merimetso-Code/EmbeddedAutomotiveSecurity/blob/main/EXERCISE10.zip)

Using source analysis you would identify a set of possible vulnerabilities and then using the Universal Debugger Engine (UDE), SPC5 Studio and Radare2/Cutter you should validate the vulnerabilities and develop appropriate exploit code.
