# EmbeddedAutomotiveSecurity

This training is geared towards offensive security researchers, penetration testers or red teamers who want to dip their toes into the field of automotive security. The basis of this training are developments boards that give the attendees a practical introduction to bus systems such as CAN, LIN and FlexRay. After the students have learned about common ECU classes, protocols and the AUTOSAR standards we will write some parts of an ECU ourselves to put us in the position of a developer. We then switch to an offensive security perspective and take apart and analyse an ECU image step by step until we will have (a) working exploit(s) against that system at the end of the week.

In contrast to other trainings, we will not look into infotainment units as we see them as too similar to other embedded and mobile systems. Rather we will concentrate on the specifics of automotive embedded systems. To help with this process we will show the attendees how to snapshot and emulate systems to be faster in assessing them.
