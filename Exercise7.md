# Exercises 7 - Reverse engineering functionality and finding bugs (continued)

The goal of this excercise is to use the kill chain in analysing the software for the ECU and developing an exploit. The two stages that we are going to explore in this exercise are:

* Reconnaissance 
* Weaponization

So, to start with dowanload the compressed package and uncompress it.

This tutorial is structured in two parts. In the first part you are required to perform Reconnaissance on the softawre for the MPC5748G ECU, and the second part you will be required to validate the expliot.
