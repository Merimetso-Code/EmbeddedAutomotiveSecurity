# Exercise 9 - Understanding Schematics

The goal of this exercise is to use design schematics and open source intelligence to identify access points. You should use the following documentation to identify possible physical access points that may be vulnerable to attack.

* [SPC560P - Design](https://github.com/Merimetso-Code/EmbeddedAutomotiveSecurity/blob/main/SPC560P-Design.pdf)
* [SPC560P - Documentations](https://github.com/Merimetso-Code/EmbeddedAutomotiveSecurity/blob/main/SPC560P-Ref-Man.pdf)

They elements to consider are:

* What protocols/interfaces can we access. For Example: JTAG, SPI, I2C, CAN, FLEX, USB and Ethernet.
* PCB routing of connections between Integrated Circuits [IC].
* What ICs are being used and do they have unused access points.
