# Exercise 9 - Understanding and doodling schematics

The goal of this exercise is to use design schematics and open source intelligence to identify access points. You should use the following documentation to identify possible physical accesspoints that may ne vulberable to attack.

* [MPC5748G - Data Sheet](https://github.com/Merimetso-Code/EmbeddedAutomotiveSecurity/blob/main/MPC5748G.pdf)
* [MPC5748G - Design Scematics](https://github.com/Merimetso-Code/EmbeddedAutomotiveSecurity/blob/main/DEVKIT-MPC5748G-SCH.pdf)
* [MPC5748G - Design Documentations](https://github.com/Merimetso-Code/EmbeddedAutomotiveSecurity/blob/main/DEVKIT-MPC5748G.zip)

They elements to consider are:

* What protocols/interfaces can we access. For Example: JTAG, SPI, I2C, CAN, FLEX, USB and Ethernet.
* PCB routing of connections between Intergrate Circuits [IC].
* What ICs are being used and do they have unused access points.
