# Exercise 3 - Use JTAG to snapshot a device for emulation

This is not really an exercise, it is more of series of directed reading, links and videos. The MPC5748G development board does support JTAG and it allows for a programming to make use of the JTAG interface via a JTAG adapter and an On-Chip Debugger. 

For those students interested in using JTAG I would rewcoemend the following Books.

* [Hardware Security: A Hands-on Learning Approach](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hardware-Security-Hands-Learning-Approach/dp/0128124776/ref=sr_1_11?dchild=1&keywords=JTAG&qid=1628006748&s=books&sr=1-11)
* [Practical Hardware Pentesting](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Hardware-Pentesting-attacking-protecting/dp/1789619130/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Practical+Hardware&qid=1628006813&s=books&sr=1-1)
